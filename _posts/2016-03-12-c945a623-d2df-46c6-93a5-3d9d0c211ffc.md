Joshua Harmon is an up and coming chef in the DFW area who is striving every day to own that title. His Momma and Grandmomma, who he grew up watching cook for those they love, inspired Josh to carry that same love into his own life.

Josh has cooked, trailed, and trained at some of the best restaurants in the country. Places like Le Cirque and Buddhaken and he's just getting started.

These are a few of Josh's favorite tastes; music, food, or otherwise; mogui (gremlins), fish cheek, noodles, runny eggs, fried chicken, Jason an the Agornauts, OG Little Rascals, Boz Scaggs, Bone Thug, Arcade Fire, Welcome Back Cotter, Chicken and Dumplings, Shrimp and Grits, and of course good butter.
