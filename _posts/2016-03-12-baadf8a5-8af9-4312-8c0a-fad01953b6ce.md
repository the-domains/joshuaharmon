Josh is an rising chef in the DFW area who is striving every day to own that title.  His Momma and Grandmomma who he grew up watching cook for those they love, inspiring Josh to carry that love into his own life. 

Josh has cooked for some of the best chefs in the country from (blank) to (blank) and he's just getting started.  These are a few of Josh's favorite tastes, music, food, or otherwise: mogui (gremlins), fish cheek noodles, runny eggs, fried chicken, Jason and the Agornauts, OG Little Rascals, Boz Scaggs, Bone Thug, Arcade Fire, Welcome Back Cotter, Chicken and Dumplings, Shrimp and Grits, and of course good butter.
